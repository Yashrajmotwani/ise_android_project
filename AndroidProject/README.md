# ISE ANDROID STUDIO PROJECT - IIT TIRUPATI CSE DEPT

Project for Industrial Software Engineering for IIT Tirupati CSE.  
This folder contains the Code for the Android Studio Project made in Kotlin.

## Working
Need to ensure:
1. Internet connectivity
2. Render is running or locally, server.js is running and the app has updated URL.
3. Location is 'on' for the notifications feature  

Without the above, the data will not be correctly retrieved from the MongoDB Atlas Database, the Maps feature will not work correctly and the Notifications will not be received. Also, it should be ensured that app is allowed access to the location when the View Maps feature is used, which might require you to go back and restart that feature.
